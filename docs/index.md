## Info
Derrick is an open source project that help you to migrate a application to cloud native containerized application. 

Docker Container is cool enough but it is not very easy to set up a complex program with it alone.    
Sometimes you need K8S or Swarm to orchestrate your service and SLB(Server Load Balancer) to balance network flow and so on.
