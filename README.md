Derrick: a dockerize tool for Aliyun Container Service
======================================================
Derrick is an open source project to set up your project and deploy to Aliyun Container Service.    

Docker Container is cool enough but it is not very easy to set up a complex program with it alone.    
Sometimes you need K8S or Swarm to orchestrate your service and SLB(Server Load Balancer) to balance network flow and so on.
